By utilizing Python tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project explores hotel performance, traveler behaviors, and the impact of amenities on review scores.
#### 2. Folder Structure
To ensure clear organization, the repository is structured as follows:
- Part1_Basic_Exploration.ipynb: Initial data loading, structural analysis, and data cleaning processes.
- Part2_Business_Questions.ipynb: Detailed analysis of business questions and generation of data visualizations.
- plots/: Directory containing all generated visualizations (e.g., Histogram of scores, Boxplots by traveler type and hotel stars).
- report/: Folder for the final 3-page "Hotel Analytics Report".
- Las VegasTripAdvisorReviews-Dataset.csv: The raw dataset used for analysis.

   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) in an environment like VS Code or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in order to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

#### 4. What Outputs are produced?
The project generates several key outputs:
- Cleaned Data Summary: Insights from a dataset of 491 observations after removing irrelevant or high-missing-value columns like status and Unnamed: 15.
